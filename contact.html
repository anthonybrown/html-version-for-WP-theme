			<h2>Web design and development</h2>
			<p>
				I love hand crafting websites and web applications from scratch. Working with you to flush out the look and feel of your specific needs, 
				all my work is 100% original. At the initial meeting we will discuss the needs of your project.		
			</p>
			<p>
				Is your project goal driven, or is it budget friven ? Whatever the circumstances are we 
				can work together to flush out the best possible solution for the project.

			<h2>Graphic and Logo Work</h2>
			<p>
				Creating logos, icons, character development for animations of advertisements ? I love it, I have created custom logos for individuals, 
				small companies and the world		
			</p>
			<p>
				Logos are the way your brand is going to first communicate with your target audience, I put a lot of thought into developing your logo, I 
				need to know what the company is about, what the companies perceived image is and what the company wants it’s image to be perceived as
				.

			<h2>Custom Wordpress Themes</h2>
			<p>
				Wordpress is the words most popular publishing platform there is. I love what you can do with it, I can basically give my clients any kind 
				of site they are looking for and do it in a really short time.			
			</p>
			<p>
				Wordpress is not just a blogging software, it is very modular in design, this is the main reason I use it, for a small web shop such as 
				mine it gives us and the client a solution that is both powerful and maintainable.

					Once all the information is gathered, it is processed and a plan if formed. This is the first step in the strategic process that I use.
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					This stage sets up a direction for the project to follow. Once a budget and timeline are formed, the technologies needed to accomplish 
					the goals are weighed out over the timeline and budget.	
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					I ask questions, gather your ideas,
					learn your business objectives and wrap my mind around what needs to be done to accomplish your goals
				</p>

				<h1 class="plan">design</h1>
				<img src="img/design.png" alt="planning image" />
				<p class="plan">
					With the plan established, design and concept can begin to take place. The design process consists of some initial sketches to make 
					sure we are communicated well. Then I start with the wireframe of what the application will look like.
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					Through this process, the idea is shown and appropriate changes are made while in the initial phase, there is no need for a major 
					revisions.
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					Through constant refinement of the initial sketch, I am able to narrow down the design to the final solution
				</p>

				<h1 class="plan">build</h1>
				<img src="img/build.png" alt="planning image" />
				<p class="plan">
					Once the design has gone through the process and the final draft is approved, the meticulous process of slicing and coding your project 
					can begin.
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					The appropriate technologies will be used, I hand craft all the code and use semantic standards based practices that are industries 
					highest standards. Pixel perfect placement and cross browser compatibility are tested and refined.
				</p>
				<p class="plan">
					We test and test and then test some more until we are sure that your site gets the seal of approval.
				</p>

				<img class="launch" src="img/launch.png" alt="planning image" />
				<p class="plan launch">
					Houston we have a go !
				</p>
				<p class="plan launch">
					Once we are satisfied that all is well and your site performs in all the major browsers and plateforms, we lanch the site in a live 
					environment.		
				</p>
				<p class="plan launch">
					Once the project is live, I will continue to be in touch to make sure that the application or site is working on the live server. 
					Support is as long or little as you want
					and your site will be burned on a CD for your personal backup incash your server melts or something bad happens, you will be covered
