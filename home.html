				<h2>Web design and development</h2>
				<p>
					I love hand crafing websites and web applications from scratch. Working with you to flush out the look and 
					feel of your specific needs, all my work is 100% orginal. At the initial meeting we will discuss the needs of 
					your project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is your project goal driven, or is it budget friven ? Whatever the circumstances are we 
					can work together to flush out the best possible solution for the project

				<h2>Logo and Graphic work</h2>
				<p>
					Creating logos, icons, charactor development for animations of advertisments ? I love it, I have created 
					custom logos for individuals, small companies and the world	
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Logos are the way your brand is going to first communicate with your target audience, I put a lot of thought 
					into developing your logo, I need to know what the company is about, what the companies precieved image is 
					and what the company wants it’s image to be precieved as

				<h2>Custom Wordpress Themes</h2>
				<p>
					Wordpress is the words most popular publishing platform there is. I love what you can do with it, I can 
					basically give my clients any kind of site they are looking for and do it in a really short time.	
				</p>
				<p>
					Wordpress is not just a blogging software, it is very modular in design, this is the main reason I use it, 
					for a small web shop such as mine it gives us and the client a solution that is both powerful and 
					maintainable.

					<h1 class="fourth">Plan</h1>
					<p>
						Once all the information is gathered, it is processed and a plan if formed. This is the first step in the 
						strategic process that I use.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This stage sets up a direction for the project to follow. Once a budget and timeline are formed, the 
						technologies needed to accomplish the goals are weighed out over the timeline and budget.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ask questions, gather your ideas,
						learn your business objectives and wrap my mind around what needs to be done to accomplish your goals
					</p>
				</article>
				
				<article class="fourth design">
					<h1 class="fourth">Design</h1>
					<p>
						With the plan established, design and concept can begin to take place. The design process consists of 
						some initial sketches to make sure we are communicated well. Then I start with the wireframe of what the 
						application will look like.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through this process, the idea is shown and appropriate changes are made while in the initial phase, 
						there is no need for a major revisions
					</p>
					<p>
						Through constant refinement of the initial sketch, I am able to narrow down the design to the final 
						solution
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="fourth build">
					<h1 class="fourth">Build</h1>
					<p>
						Once the design has gone through the process and the final draft is approved, the meticulous process of 
						slicing and coding your project can begin.		
					</p>
					<p>
						The appropriate technologies will be used, I hand craft all the code and use semantic standards based 
						practices that are industries highest standards. Pixel perfect placement and cross browser compatiability 
						are tested and refined.	
					</p>
					<p>
						We test and test and then test some more until we are sure that your site gets the seal of approval.
					</p>
				</article>
				
				<article class="fourth launch">
					<h1  class="fourth">Launch</h1>
					<p>
						Houston we have a go !
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we are satisfied that all is well and your site performs in all the major browsers and plateforms, 
						we launch the site in a live environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the project is live, I will continue to be in touch to make sure that the application or site is 
						working on the live server. Support is as long or little as you want
						and your site will be burned on a CD for your personal backup incash your server melts or something bad 
						happens, you will be covered
